# Optimal column design 

This repository implements an optimisation-based approach to design of
distillation column internals based on the constraints discussed in
Coulson and Richardson's Chemical Engineering, Vol 6.

The code was started as the outcome of a course in optimisation at the
University of Pretoria, but other contributions are welcome.
